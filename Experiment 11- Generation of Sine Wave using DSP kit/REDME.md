## Theory 
Sinusoidal are the smoothest signals with no abrupt variation in their amplitude, the amplitude witnesses gradual change with time. Sinusoidal signals can be defined as a periodic signal with waveform as that of a sine wave. The amplitude of sine wave increases from a value of 0 at 0° angle to a maximum value of 1 at 90°, it further reaches its minimum value of -1 at 270° and then return to 0 at 360°. After any angle greater than 360°, the sinusoidal signal repeats the values so we can say that period of sinusoidal signal is 2π i.e. 360°.If we observe the graph, we can see that the amplitude varying gradually with a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. We can also observe that the wave begins to repeat its value after a period or angle value of 2π hence periodicity of sinusoidal signal is 2π.
