## Theory
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters are a type of digital filter characterized by a finite duration of the impulse response. The window method is a common technique used to design FIR filters. This method involves multiplying an ideal (infinite) impulse response by a window function to create a realizable FIR filter. The FIR filter coefficients h[n] are obtained by multiplying the ideal impulse response by the chosen window function. The frequency response of the FIR filter can be analyzed using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The window function influences the main lobe width and side lobe levels in the frequency response. A narrower main lobe provides better frequency resolution, while lower side lobes reduce spectral leakage.
